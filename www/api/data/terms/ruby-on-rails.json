{"blurb":"Ruby on Rails, often simply Rails, is an open source web application framework which runs via the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.","created":"2014-03-06 08:59:44","url":"http://rubyonrails.org/","technology":"ruby-on-rails","updated":null,"id":"16","wikipedia_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby-on-rails"}
