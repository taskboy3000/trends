{"blurb":".NET Framework (pronounced dot net) is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large library and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. The class library and the CLR together constitute .NET Framework.","created":"2014-03-06 09:00:57","url":"http://www.microsoft.com/net","technology":".net","updated":null,"id":"19","wikipedia_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework"}
